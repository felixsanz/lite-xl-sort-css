# Lite-XL Sort CSS Plugin

Lite-XL plugin to sort selected CSS properties alphabetically or using the concentric model by Brandon Rhodes (https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2011/concentric-css/).

*This plugin is based on [vscode-sort-selection-concentrically](https://github.com/roubaobaozi/vscode-sort-selection-concentrically).*

## Installation

Navigate to the plugins folder (usually ~/.config/lite-xl/plugins) and run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/felixsanz/lite-xl-sortcss sortcss
```

Alternatively the `init.lua` file can be renamed `sortcss.lua` and dropped in the plugins folder.

## Usage

1. Select CSS code (must have one property per line).
2. Press `control+alt+a` to sort alphabetically or `control+alt+c` to sort concentrically. Alternatively you can also right-click and select the appropriate option.
